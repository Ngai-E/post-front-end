      <span class="fw-bolder">2.1 Ownership: </span>
      The App and its contents, including but not limited to the software,

      By posting or submitting content through the App, you grant us a
      non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, publicly

    </p>

    <h3>3. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an "as-is" and "as available" basis. We expressly
      disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
      including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability,
      fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any
      indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
      including, but not limited to, loss of profits, data, or goodwill, or any
      other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or
      inability to access or use the App; (ii) any conduct or content of any
      third party on the App; (iii) any content obtained from the App; and (iv)
      unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content,
      whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any
      other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the
      possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found
      to have failed of its essential purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and their
      respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any
      and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including
      attorneys' fees), arising out of or in connection with: (i) your use of
      the App; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms; (iii) our
      use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of the rights of any

    <h3>6. Termination</h3>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without
      prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without
      limitation, if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use
      the App will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you
      may simply discontinue using the App. All provisions of these Terms which
      by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
      including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
      indemnity, and limitations of liability.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
      of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
      You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in
      the United States, and any cause of action that relates to or arises from
      these Terms must be filed therein unless subject to binding arbitration as
      described below.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Arbitration</h3>
    <p>
      For any dispute you have with us, you agree to first contact us and
      attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we have not been
      able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve
      any claim or controversy arising out of or in connection with or relating
      to these Terms by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator in the United
      States under the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association.
      The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
      reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other
      witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
      entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section
      shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other
      equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or
      threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data
      security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Changes to These Terms</h3>
    <p>
      We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these
      Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30
      days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a
      material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
    </p>
